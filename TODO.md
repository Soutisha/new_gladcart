# TODO: Debug and Complete Gladcart E-commerce Website

## Information Gathered
- The project has two versions of the code: inline React in `index.html` (incomplete/truncated) and a full React component in `GladcartWebsite.jsx`.
- `package.json` indicates a React app with dependencies like React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React.
- The website includes full e-commerce flow: login/signup, browse products, add to cart, checkout (address, payment, review), order placement, orders history, profile, wishlist, AR try-on simulation.
- Potential issues: `index.html` code is truncated; missing proper React app structure (no `src/index.js`); possible runtime errors in state management or rendering.

## Plan
1. Set up proper React app structure to use `GladcartWebsite.jsx` as the main component.
2. Install dependencies and run the app to identify errors.
3. Debug and fix any console errors, rendering issues, or broken functionality.
4. Test the complete user flow: sign up/login → browse products → add to cart → checkout (address → payment → review) → place order → view orders/delivery status.
5. Ensure responsive design and all features work (wishlist, try-on, cart updates, etc.).
6. Verify payment simulation and order confirmation.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- Create `src/index.js` to render the `GladcartWebsite` component.
- Update `index.html` if needed for proper entry point.
- Fix any bugs in `GladcartWebsite.jsx` (e.g., missing imports, state issues).

## Followup Steps
- Run `npm install` and `npm start`.
- Use browser to test the flow and capture screenshots/logs for errors.
- Fix identified issues iteratively.
- Confirm all pages load and interactions work without errors.
